           <h3>Overview</h3>
           
                 <p>The newest game out of Sumo Digital is a stealth-heeavy PvE-PvP third-person shooter that is based on the popular legend of Robin Hood(and <em>yes you will be able to steal from the rich!</em>). It has been released both on console and PC platforms. It is a 4 on 4 match where both teams attempt to accomplish the same goals, often clashing into each other in the process. Players will struggle to evade the eyes of the NPCs as well as the other team.  </p>

                 <h3>Combat</h3>
                 <p>I'll admit there is certainly a learning curve to the style of combat. It may be tempting to run up to your enemy and start button mashing, but since all of your moves require you to spend something called stamina, this will cause you to exhaust all of it too quickly and you'll be an open target, unable to block. Depending on your character there will either be a dodge or a block move which is your defense. You'll have either some type of melee weapon or a bow which will be your offense. So in total, you end up in these stand-offs where youre trying to attack at the moment your opponent isnt blocking, and visa versa. <em>However,</em> all characters have the option of assasinating your enemy in one shot if you can manage to sneak up behind them!</p>

                 <h3>Objectives</h3>
                  <p>When you begin the game you'll have 3 objectives to accomplish, and youll get paid for each one regardless of who wins the match. The first objective is to find the sheriff who spawns randomly on the map and youll have to sneak up and steal his key. Secondly, youll have to take the key and open the vault. Which also spawns randomly on the map. Lastly, youll have to bring the chest from the vault onto the getaway boat and crank it up to the deck. All the while your enemy team is trying to accomplish the <em>exact same things!</em> Oh, did I mention that sheriff is unkillable and he walks around autp killing players at random?</p>

                 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                 <p>This game has alot of potential and it plays smooth right out of the box. Were told the developers guarentee a full years worth of updates and new content to look forward too. If you can power through ten games to get the feel for the combat, this game quickly becomes a blast. Especially with friends on the squad!</p>

                  <p>Here's what PC gamer had to say:</p>
                  <article>
                        <p>"Hood: Outlaws and Legends is the latest game looking to grab some of that PvPvE plunder, bringing with it some interesting ideas: a third-person perspective, a focus on stealth, and an indestructible sheriff who stomps around maps like an ironclad Mr X, grumbling and swearing about the vault key that one of the players has stolen off him." -PC Gamer</p>
